# Robust
R code for robust algorithms


Deterministic MCD is used to deal with dataset with different types of outlier, including high residual and bad leverage points. Corresponding simulation code is in generate_detect_outlier_in_one.R, where types of outlier are generated.

Imputation is to deal with dataset with missing value. Corresponding simulation code is in Simulation.R, where missing value scheme is deployed.
